# Project Overview: Automation of Bdjobs Pro Subscription Service
In this project, I developed an automation script using Selenium WebDriver in Java to interact with the Bdjobs Pro subscription service on the bdjobs.com platform. The script automates the process of logging in, navigating through the site, and interacting with various features of the Bdjobs Pro service.

# Key Features of the Automation Script
# 1. Login Automation:
- The script automates the login process by entering credentials and handling the navigation to the dashboard.
  
# 2. Bdjobs Pro Navigation:
- After logging in, the script navigates to the Bdjobs Pro section. It handles multiple windows and switches between them to ensure smooth navigation.
# 3. Package Selection and Interaction:
- The script automates the selection of different subscription packages (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) and checks the details of each package.
- It also handles the interaction with various collapsible sections to review the benefits and limits associated with each package.
  
# 4. Payment Method Verification:
- The script verifies that all payment methods (Bkash, Card, and others) are clickable and functional.
- It automates the process of selecting a payment method and proceeding to the payment confirmation step.
# 5. FAQ Interaction:
- The script loops through all FAQ panels on the page, automating the process of opening and closing each panel to ensure they function as expected.

# 6. Error Handling:
- The script is equipped with try-catch blocks to handle any unexpected issues that may arise during execution, ensuring robustness and reliability.
  
# 7. Use of JavaScript Executor:
- JavaScript Executor is used to handle situations where elements are not directly clickable, ensuring smooth scrolling and interaction.
  
 This project showcases the automation of complex user interactions with a web-based service, improving efficiency in testing and verifying the functionality of Bdjobs Pro.
